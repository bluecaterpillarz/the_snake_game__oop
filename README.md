# 🐍 The Snake Game (OOP & Inheritance)

The famous Snake game implemented in Python using the built-in `turtle` module.

This project was designed to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, with a particular focus on **class inheritance**, modular design, and clean separation of responsibilities.

## 🎮 Features

- Arrow key controls
- Snake grows when food is collected
- Real-time score tracking
- Game over on wall collision
- Game over on self-collision

## 🧠 OOP & Inheritance Design

The game is structured using multiple classes, following OOP principles:

- **Inheritance** is used to extend shared behavior from base classes  
- Each game component (snake, food, scoreboard) has a clear responsibility  
- Logic is separated into independent, reusable modules  

This design improves readability, scalability, and maintainability of the codebase.
